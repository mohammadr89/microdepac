PROPER ACKNOWLEDGEMENT WHEN USING THE LASSO ALPHA 2 RELEASE

At the time of the release, the Alpha 2 simulations and tools
are not yet documented in a peer reviewed article. We therefore
request that users publishing with the LASSO products consider
including appropriate LASSO team members as co-authors. Contact
the LASSO principal investigator (PI) (william.gustafson@pnnl.gov)
for specifics regarding the different team member contributions.

The LASSO Alpha 2 documentation and dataset have separate DOIs
due to technical details related to the way hosting of the
information is handled, and therefore, they should be cited
separately. The recommended citation for the documentation is:

  Gustafson, WI, AM Vogelmann, X Cheng, S Endo, B Krishna, Z
  Li, T Toto, and H Xiao, 2017: Description of the LASSO Alpha 2
  Release. Ed. by R. Stafford, DOE Atmospheric Radiation Measurement
  Research Facility, DOE/SC-ARM-TR-199, doi:10.2172/1376727.

And, the recommended citation for the Alpha 2 data is:

  Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Climate Research Facility,
  2017: LASSO Alpha 2 Data Bundles. <<dates of the data used, e.g., 10
  Jun 2016 or various dates>>, 36° 36' 18.0" N, 97° 29' 6.0" W: Southern
  Great Plains Central Facility (C1). Compiled by WI Gustafson, AM
  Vogelmann, X Cheng, S Endo, B Krishna, Z Li, T Toto, and H Xiao. ARM
  Data Archive: Oak Ridge, Tennessee, USA. Data set accessed <<insert
  date downloaded from web>> at http://dx.doi.org/10.5439/1342961.

At a minimum, ARM requests the following acknowledgement:

  LASSO data were used from the U.S. Department of Energy's
  Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Climate Research Facility.
