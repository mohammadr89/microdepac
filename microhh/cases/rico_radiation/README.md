# RICO Precipitating shallow cumulus case adapted for coupled radiative transfer

## Case description
This case contains the case as documented in the paper of *van Zanten et al. (2014): Controls on precipitation and cloudiness in simulations of
trade-wind cumulus as observed during RICO, JAMES*, adapted for running with coupled radiative transfer
