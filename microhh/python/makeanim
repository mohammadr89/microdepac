# use H.264 compression to create very high quality and small file size movies 
# (use "avconv" as the executable name in case libav is installed instead of ffmpeg). 
# framerate is the fps of the movie
# r is the number of frames per second in the output, leading to duplicates in case framerate < r
#
# ONE PASS FILTERING (aim for constant quality)
# crf is quality (0 is lossless, 15 is very good, 23 is standard)
ffmpeg -framerate 15 -i figs/frame.%05d.png -s:v 1280x720 -c:v libx264 \
  -profile:v high -crf 15 -pix_fmt yuv420p -r 25 movie.mp4

# TWO PASS FILTERING (aim for constant bitrate)
# b:v is the bitrate (for high quality use 10000k for 720p and 16000k for 1080p)
